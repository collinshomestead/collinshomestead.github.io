				<p>Highland Homestead began as one man's dream to own land and raise cattle.<br/>
				The Collins family has lived outside of Riley, Kansas on 20 acres for almost 10 years 
				and in that time have raised cattle, chickens, goats, pigs, ducks, and rabbits with 
				respect and care for the creature while honoring the Creator. Cameron and his wife Susan 
				focus on not only raising healthy animals, but happy ones too.</p>
