<h1>Good food.</h1>
	<p>Highland Homestead began as one man's dream to own land and raise cattle.<br/>
	The Collins family has lived outside of Riley, Kansas on 20 acres for almost 10 years and have raised cattle, 			chickens, goats, pigs, ducks, and rabbits with respect and care for the creature while honoring the Creator. Cameron and 		his wife Susan focus on not only raising healthy animals, but happy ones too.</p>
