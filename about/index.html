<h1>Natural Family Farming</h1>
	<p>Highland Homestead is a small farm on 20-acres in Northeast Kansas. We raise Scottish Highland cattle, Nubian and Boer goats, rabbits, chickens, ducks, and a turkey, as well as the occasional pigs. <br/><br/>
	We don't believe in using hormones or unnecessary antibiotics and think that if animals are raised naturally, eating what they are supposed to eat, they will live healthier lives. Healthier animals means healthier meats and eggs. Our products are packed with nutritious omega-3s and flavor.<br/><br/>
	We also think that is part of our responsibilty to give our animals happy lives while they are here on our farm. Our family spends quality time with the animals and care is given to raise animals with mild, friendly temperments. <br/><br/>
